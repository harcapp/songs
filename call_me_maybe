<G
I threw a wish in the well
e
Don't ask me, I'll never tell
C
I looked to you as it fell
D
And now you're in my way
<G
I trade my soul for a wish
e
Pennies and dimes for a kiss
C
I wasn't looking for this
D
But now you're in my way
<G
Your stare was holdin'
e
Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
C
Hot not, wind was blowin'
D
Where you think you're going, baby?

<G
You took your time with the call
e
I took no time with the fall
C
You gave me nothing at all
D
But still, you're in my way
<G
I beg, and borrow and steal
e
Have foresight and it's real
C
I didn't know I would feel it
D
But it's in my way
<G
Your stare was holdin'
e
Ripped jeans, skin was showin'
C
Hot not, wind was blowin'
D
Where you think you're going, baby?
