Yellow submarine yellow submarine

In the town where I was born 
C G
Lived a man who sailed the sea
e a
And he told us of his life
C D
In the land of submarines
<G D
So we sailed up to the sun 
C G
Till we found the sea of green 
e a
And we lived beneath the waves 
C D
In our yellow submarine
<
<G D
And our friends are all on board 
C G
Many more of them live next door 
e a
And the band begins to play...

<G D
As we live a life of ease 
C G
Everyone of us has all we need 
e a
Sky of blue and sea of green 
C D
In our yellow submarine
