Yesterday all my troubles seemed so far away
F G C
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
F G F C
Oh I believe in yesterday
<C E a
Suddenly I'm not half the man I used to be
F G C
There's a shadow hanging over me
F G F C
Oh yesterday come suddenly
<C E a
Why she had to go
F G C
I don't know. She wouldn't stay
C E a
I said something wrong
F G F C
Now I long for yesterday
<C E a
Yesterday love was such an easy game to play
F G C
Now I need a place to hide away
F G F C
Oh I believe in yesterday
