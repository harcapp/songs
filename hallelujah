<F a
Hallelujah, hallelujah
F C G C
Hallelujah, hallelujah
<C a
I’ve heard there was a secret chord
C a
That David played and it pleased the Lord
F G C G
But you don’t really care for music do you?


C F G
It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
a F
The minor fall, the major lift
G e a
The baffled King composing Hallelujah
<
<C a
Your faith was strong but you needed proof
C a
You saw her bathing on the roof
F G C G
Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew you


C F G
She tied you to a kitchen chair
a F
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
G e a
And from your lips she drew the hallelujah
<
<C a
Maybe I’ve been here before
C a
I know this room, I’ve walked this floor
F G C G
I used to live alone before I knew you


C F G
I’ve seen your flag on the marble arch
a F
Love is not a victory march
G e a
It’s a cold and it’s a broken hallelujah
<
<C a
There was a time when you let me know
C a
What’s real and going on below
F G C G
But now you never show it to me, do you?


C F G
And remember when I moved in you
a F
The Holy Dark was moving too
G e a
And every breath we drew was hallelujah
<
<C a
Maybe there’s a God above
C a
And all I ever learned from love
F G C G
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you


C F G
And it’s not a cry you can hear at night
a F
It’s not somebody who’s seen the light
G e a
It’s a cold and it’s a broken hallelujah
